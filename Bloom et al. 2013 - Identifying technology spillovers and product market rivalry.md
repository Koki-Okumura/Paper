# IDENTIFYING TECHNOLOGY SPILLOVERS AND PRODUCT MARKET RIVALRY 

By NicholAS BloOm, MARK SchANKERMAN, AND JOHN VAN REENEN ${ }^{1}$

The impact of $R \& D$ on growth through spillovers has been a major topic of economic research over the last thirty years. A central problem in the literature is that firm performance is affected by two countervailing "spillovers" : a positive effect from technology (knowledge) spillovers and a negative business stealing effects from product market rivals. We develop a general framework incorporating these two types of spillovers and implement this model using measures of a firm's position in technology space and product market space. Using panel data on U.S. firms, we show that technology spillovers quantitatively dominate, so that the gross social returns to R\&D are at least twice as high as the private returns. We identify the causal effect of $R \& D$ spillovers by using changes in federal and state tax incentives for $R \& D$. We also find that smaller firms generate lower social returns to R\&D because they operate more in technological niches. Finally, we detail the desirable properties of an ideal spillover measure and how existing approaches, including our new Mahalanobis measure, compare to these criteria.

KEYWORDS: Spillovers, R\&D, market value, patents, productivity.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R\&D) spillovers have been a major topic in the growth, productivity, and industrial organization literatures for many decades. Theoretical studies have explored the impact of $R \& D$ on the strategic interaction among firms and long run growth. ${ }^{2}$ While many empirical studies appear to support the presence of technology spillovers, there remains a major problem at the heart of the literature. This arises from the fact that R\&D generates at least two distinct types of "spillover" effects. The first is technology (or knowledge) spillovers, which may increase the productivity of other firms that operate in similar technology areas. The second type of spillover is the product market rivalry effect of $\mathrm{R} \& \mathrm{D}$. Whereas technology spillovers are beneficial to other firms, R\&D by product market rivals has a negative effect on a firm's value due to business stealing. Despite much theoretical research on product market rivalry effects of $R \& D$ (including patent race models), there has been[^0]example, if $k_{0}$ increases the demand for firm 0 (e.g., product innovation), its profits would increase for any given level of price in the second stage. ${ }^{9}$

The best responses for firms 0 and $m$ are given by $x_{0}^{*}=\arg \max _{x_{0}} \pi\left(x_{0}, x_{m}\right.$, $\left.k_{0}\right)$ and $x_{m}^{*}=\arg \max _{x_{m}} \pi\left(x_{m}, x_{0}, k_{m}\right)$, respectively. Solving for second stage Nash decisions yields $x_{0}^{*}=f\left(k_{0}, k_{m}\right)$ and $x_{m}^{*}=f\left(k_{m}, k_{0}\right)$, where $f(\cdot)$ is our generic term for a function. First stage profit for firm 0 is $\Pi\left(k_{0}, k_{m}\right)=$ $\pi\left(k_{0}, x_{0}^{*}, x_{m}^{*}\right)$, and similarly for firm $m$. If there is no strategic interaction in the product market, $\pi\left(k_{0}, x_{0}^{*}, x_{m}^{*}\right)$ does not vary with $x_{m}$, and thus $\Pi^{0}$ does not depend on $k_{m}$. We assume that $\Pi\left(k_{0}, k_{m}\right)$ is increasing in $k_{0}$, non-increasing in $k_{m}$, and concave. ${ }^{10}$

Stage 1. Firm 0 produces innovations with its own R\&D, possibly benefiting from spillovers from firms to which it is close in technology space:

$$
\begin{equation*}
k_{0}=\phi\left(r_{0}, r_{\tau}\right) \text {, } \tag{2.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $r_{0}$ is the $\mathrm{R} \& \mathrm{D}$ of firm $0, r_{\tau}$ is the $\mathrm{R} \& \mathrm{D}$ of firm $\tau$, and we assume that the knowledge production function $\phi(\cdot)$ is non-decreasing and concave in both arguments. This means that if there are technology spillovers, they are necessarily positive. We assume that the function $\phi(\cdot)$ is common to all firms. Firm 0 solves the following problem:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\max _{r_{0}} V^{0}=\Pi\left(\phi\left(r_{0}, r_{\tau}\right), k_{m}\right)-r_{0} . \tag{2.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

Note that $k_{m}$ does not involve $r_{0}$. The first order condition is $\Pi_{1} \phi_{1}-1=0$, where the subscripts denote partial derivatives with respect to the different arguments. We analyze how exogenous shifts in the R\&D of technology and product market rivals $\left(\tau\right.$ and $m$ ) affect outcomes for firm $0 .{ }^{11}$ Comparative statics yield

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial r_{0}^{*}}{\partial r_{\tau}}=-\frac{\left\{\Pi_{1} \phi_{12}+\Pi_{11} \phi_{1} \phi_{2}\right\}}{H} \tag{2.3}
\end{equation*}
$$[^1]where $H=\Pi_{11} \phi_{1}^{2}+\Pi_{1} \phi_{11}<0$ by the second order conditions. If $\phi_{12}>0$, firm 0 's $R \& D$ is positively related to the $R \& D$ done by firms in the same technology space, as long as diminishing returns in knowledge production are not "too strong." On the other hand, if $\phi_{12}=0$ or diminishing returns in knowledge production are strong (i.e., $\Pi_{1} \phi_{12}<-\Pi_{11} \phi_{1} \phi_{2}$ ), then $\mathrm{R} \& \mathrm{D}$ is negatively related to the $\mathrm{R} \& \mathrm{D}$ done by firms in the same technology space. Consequently, the marginal effect $\frac{\partial r_{0}^{*}}{\partial r_{T}}$ is formally ambiguous. In addition,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial r_{0}^{*}}{\partial r_{m}}=-\frac{\Pi_{12} \phi_{1}}{H} \tag{2.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $r_{m}$ is the R\&D of firm $m$. Thus, firm 0's R\&D is an increasing (respectively, decreasing) function of the $R \& D$ done by firms in the same product market if $\Pi_{12}>0$, that is, if $k_{0}$ and $k_{m}$ are strategic complements (respectively, substitutes). ${ }^{12}$ We also obtain

$$
\begin{align*}
& \frac{\partial k_{0}}{\partial r_{\tau}}=\phi_{2} \geq 0,  \tag{2.5}\\
& \frac{\partial k_{0}}{\partial r_{m}}=0 . \tag{2.6}
\end{align*}
$$

Finally, let $V^{*}=\Pi\left(\phi\left(r_{0}^{*}, r_{\tau}\right), k_{m}\right)-r_{0}^{*}$ denote the optimized value of the firm. Using the above results and the envelope theorem, we obtain

$$
\frac{\partial V^{*}}{\partial r_{\tau}}=\Pi_{1} \frac{\partial k_{0}}{\partial r_{\tau}} \geq 0 \quad \text { and } \quad \frac{\partial V^{*}}{\partial r_{m}}=\Pi_{2} \frac{\partial k_{m}}{\partial r_{m}} \leq 0
$$

We now discuss the intuition for the basic predictions of the model, which are summarized in Table I. In the case where there is neither product market rivalry nor technology spillovers, $R \& D$ by other firms should have no influence on firm 0's decisions or market value (column (4) in Table I). Now consider the effects of $R \& D$ by firms that are close in product market space, without technology spillovers (columns (5) and (6)). First, product market rivalsâ€™ R\&D has a direct, negative influence on firm 0 's value, through the business stealing effect. This can operate through two channels-reducing the firm's profit margins or market shares, or both. The reduced form representation of profits, $\Pi\left(k_{0}, k_{m}\right)$, embeds both channels. Second, R\&D by product market rivals[^2]

Notes: See text for full derivation of these comparative static predictions. Note that the empirical predictions for the (total factor) productivity equation are identical to the patents equation. Also note that the no technology spillovers case corresponds to $\phi_{2}=0$, and technology spillovers correspond to $\phi_{2}>0$. Strategic complementarity or substitutability between rivals' knowledge stocks is given by the sign of $\Pi_{12}$. SPILLTECH is the technology-distance weighted sum of all other firms R\&D stocks. SPILLSIC is the product market-distance weighted sum of all other firms R\&D stocks. See text for details.
technological profile of the firm (we consider the endogenous allocation of R\&D efforts across fields in Section 6.1 below). Let $n_{i \tau}$ denote the number of scientists from firm $i$ in field $\tau$, and $n=\sum_{i=1}^{J} n_{i}$ denote the total number of scientists in the economy (where $n_{i}=\sum_{\tau=1}^{Y} n_{i \tau}$ ). We assume that when a scientist in technology field $\tau$ from firm $i$ is exposed to a scientist from firm $j$ in field $q$, a unit of knowledge is transferred with probability $\omega_{\tau q}$. To begin, we make three assumptions: (i) knowledge transfer occurs only within a given field, not across fields (we allow for cross-field spillovers later); (ii) the probability of transfer does not depend on the identity of the scientists involved, and (iii) the probability of a transfer is the same for each field. To summarize: $\omega_{\tau q}=\omega$ for $\tau=q$ and $\omega_{\tau q}=0$ for $\tau \neq q$. Note that learning from an encounter between scientists from firms $i$ and $j$ occurs symmetrically. An "encounter" could be face to face, such as in a conference or coffee shop, or it could be virtual, such as exchanging scientific publications online. The physical encounter interpretation is pursued when we examine geographic spillovers in Section 6.2.

The expected number of encounters between scientists of firms $i$ and $j$ in technology field $\tau$ is $n_{i \tau} n_{j \tau}$, and the expected knowledge transferred in field $\tau$ is $\omega n_{i \tau} n_{j \tau}$. The expected knowledge transferred to firm $i$ from firm $j$ is therefore

$$
\begin{equation*}
\operatorname{SPILLTECH}_{i j}=\omega \sum_{\tau=1}^{Y} n_{i \tau} n_{j \tau}=\omega \sum_{\tau=1}^{Y}\left(\frac{n_{i \tau}}{n_{i}} \frac{n_{j \tau}}{n_{j}}\right) n_{i} n_{j} \tag{3.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

Define the $1 \times Y$ vector $F_{i}=\left(F_{i 1}, \ldots, F_{i Y}\right)$, where $F_{i \tau}=\frac{n_{i \tau}}{n_{i}}$ and similarly for $F_{j}=\left(F_{j 1}, \ldots, F_{j Y}\right)$. We define the "exposure" measure of technological proximity between two firms as $T E C H_{i j}^{\mathrm{E}}=F_{i} F_{j}^{\prime} n_{i}$ and the technology spillover "pool" for firm $i$ as

$$
\begin{equation*}
S^{\prime I L L T E C H} H_{i}^{\mathrm{E}}=\omega \sum_{j \neq i} T E C H_{i j}^{\mathrm{E}} n_{j} . \tag{3.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

The spillover pool is the weighted sum of the number of scientists of other firms, where the weights are the "exposure" measure of proximity. The exposure measure is closely related to the Jaffe measure of proximity. The term $F_{i} F_{j}^{\prime}$ is the uncentered covariance between the distributions of scientists across technology fields. We call this the Jaffe covariance index, $T E C H_{i j}^{\mathrm{J}-\mathrm{COV}}$, and define the corresponding spillover measure SPILLTECH $_{i}^{\mathrm{J}-\mathrm{COV}}=\omega \sum_{j \neq i}$ TECH $_{i j}^{\mathrm{J}-\mathrm{COV}} n_{j}$. Note that TECH $_{i j}^{\mathrm{E}}=n_{i}$ TECH $_{i j}^{\mathrm{J}-\mathrm{COV}}$ so SPILLTECH ${ }_{i}^{\mathrm{E}}=n_{i}$ SPILLTECH $_{i}^{\mathrm{J}-\mathrm{COV}}$. Since the generic empirical relationships we will estimate in Section 4 take the log-linear form, estimation using the exposure and Jaffe covariance measures will be empirically equivalent.

The traditional Jaffe (1986) measure of closeness, $T E C H_{i j}^{\mathrm{J}}=\frac{F_{i} F_{j}^{\prime}}{\left(F_{i} i_{i}^{1}\right)^{1 / 2}\left(F_{j} F_{j}^{\prime}\right)^{1 / 2}}$, normalizes the uncentered covariance in $T E C H_{i j}^{\mathrm{J}-\mathrm{COV}}$ on the standard deviation
of the share vectors. This has the attractive empirical feature that the closeness measure will not automatically rise when technological fields are aggregated; that is, $F_{i} F_{i}^{\prime}$ will increase, but so will $\left(F_{i} F_{i}^{\prime}\right)^{1 / 2}\left(F_{j} F_{j}^{\prime}\right)^{1 / 2}$. Thus, the traditional Jaffe measure is more robust to aggregation across fields (e.g., moving from five digit classes to four digit classes) than the simple exposure based measures. Appendix C. 1 of the Supplemental Material discusses this in detail. For both this reason and in order to be consistent with the existing literature, we use the traditional Jaffe measures in our baseline results. However, in Section 7, we discuss the properties of many different measures of proximity in relation to some ex ante desirable features of proximity indices. We also show the robustness of our results to many alternative distance metrics in Section 6.3.

### 3.2. Mahalanobis Extension

The exposure measure treats technology areas as orthogonal to each other in the sense that knowledge is transferred only if scientists from different firms "meet" in the same technology field. There are two reasons this is incomplete. First, there is likely to be genuine knowledge complementarity across technology areas, especially in modern high-tech innovation (e.g., biomedical engineering). Second, from a measurement perspective, the plausibility of the assumption that knowledge transfers do not occur across technology areas obviously depends on the level of aggregation of fields. For example, if patent office examiners sometimes erroneously allocate patents in the class "arithmetic processing calculating" to "processing architectures and instruction processing," then we would like a distance metric to recognize these as closer together (the Mahalanobis measure below does exactly this). In this subsection, we generalize the analysis to allow for spillovers across technology fields.

Assume that $\omega_{\tau q} \geq 0$ for all $\tau, q$. Let $\Omega=\left[\omega_{\tau q}\right]$ denote the $Y \times Y$ matrix that describes the probability of knowledge transfer when two scientists from technology fields $\tau$ and $q$ meet. ${ }^{17}$ In this generalized setup, knowledge transfer occurs as long as $\omega_{\tau q}>0$. Following the earlier argument, the expected knowledge spillover between firm $i$ and $j$ is given by

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_03_03_2a4da5c3a4d5f39fb8e4g-06.jpg?height=131&width=984&top_left_y=1787&top_left_x=427)[^3]

Using the vectors $F_{i}=\left(\frac{n_{i 1}}{n_{i}}, \ldots, \frac{n_{i Y}}{n_{i}}\right)$ and $F_{j}=\left(\frac{n_{j 1}}{n_{j}}, \ldots, \frac{n_{j Y}}{n_{j} .}\right)$, we can write the Mahalanobis generalization of the exposure measure of proximity, $T E C H_{i j}^{\mathrm{EM}}$, as $T E C H_{i j}^{\mathrm{EM}}=F_{i} \Omega F_{j}^{\prime} n_{i}$. Then the spillover pool for firm $i$ is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\operatorname{SPILLTECH}_{i}^{\mathrm{EM}}=\sum_{j \neq i} T E C H_{i j}^{\mathrm{EM}} n_{j .}=\sum_{j \neq i} F_{i} \Omega F_{j}^{\prime} n_{i} n_{j} . \tag{3.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

### 3.3. Extension to Product Market Proximity

With suitable reinterpretation, the preceding microfoundations for technological proximity measures can also be applied to measures of product market closeness. The basic idea is that each "encounter" between two firms in a product market generates a (probabilistic) leakage of information that can be used by one firm to compete more effectively with the other (inducing the product market rivalry effect discussed in the theoretical model in Section 1). In this case, we reinterpret the $n_{i q}$ as the number of sales agents, which we proxy by sales from firm $i$ in product market $q$. To keep the notation distinct, we use a "tilde" to denote variables for product market closeness, for example, $\tilde{n}_{i q}$ rather than $n_{i q}$. We define the vector $\tilde{F}_{i}=\left(\tilde{F}_{i 1}, \ldots, \tilde{F}_{i Y}\right)$, where $\tilde{F}_{i \tau}=\frac{\tilde{n}_{i \tau}}{\tilde{n}_{i}}$, as the distribution of firm $i$ 's sales across the different product markets in which it operates. Following the same argument as before, we obtain the exposure measure of product market proximity between firms $i$ and $j, S I C_{i j}^{\mathrm{E}}=\tilde{F}_{i} \tilde{F}_{j}^{\prime} \tilde{n}_{i}$, and the product market spillover "pool" for firm $i$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
S P I L L S I C_{i}^{\mathrm{E}}=\tilde{\omega} \sum_{j \neq i} S I C_{i j}^{\mathrm{E}} \tilde{n}_{j} \tag{3.5}
\end{equation*}
$$

As before, we can also derive a Mahalanobis version of the product market proximity and spillover measures. Since this is trivial, we skip that derivation for brevity. However, it is worth reiterating that, as with the technology measure, the exposure measure of product market closeness treats product markets as orthogonal to each other. This is unrealistic because product market information in one area is likely to benefit firms in other, related product markets. ${ }^{18}$ In addition, the plausibility of the assumption that product market knowledge transfers do not occur across product market fields obviously depends on the level of aggregation of these fields. For both reasons, the Mahalanobis generalization is also important for the product market measures of proximity and spillovers.[^4]basic technology closeness measure is calculated as the uncentered correlation between all firm $i, j$ pairings, following Jaffe (1986):

$$
\begin{equation*}
T E C H_{i j}=\frac{\left(T_{i} T_{j}^{\prime}\right)}{\left(T_{i} T_{i}^{\prime}\right)^{1 / 2}\left(T_{j} T_{j}^{\prime}\right)^{1 / 2}} \tag{3.6}
\end{equation*}
$$

For notational simplicity, in what follows, we simply denote this as $T E C H_{i j}$ (rather than $T E C H_{i j}^{\mathrm{J}}$ ). This index ranges between zero and 1, depending on the degree of overlap in technology, and is symmetric to firm ordering, so that $T E C H_{i j}=T E C H_{j i} .^{20}$ We construct the pool of technology spillover R\&D for firm $i$ in year $t$, SPILLTECH $_{i t}$, as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{SPILLTECH}_{i t}=\sum_{j \neq i} \operatorname{TECH}_{i j} G_{j t} \tag{3.7}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $G_{j t}$ is the stock of $\mathrm{R} \& \mathrm{D}$. The stock of $\mathrm{R} \& \mathrm{D}$ is our empirical analog to the number of scientists, $n_{j}$, discussed in Section 3.1.

### 3.6. Calculating Product Market Proximity

Our main measure of product market closeness uses the Compustat Segment Dataset on each firm's sales, broken down into four digit industry codes (lines of business). On average, each firm reports sales in 5.2 different four digit industries, spanning 597 industries across the sample. We use the average share of sales per industry within each firm as our measure of activity by product market, defining the vector $S_{i}=\left(S_{i 1}, S_{i 2}, \ldots, S_{i 597}\right)$, where $S_{i k}$ is the share of sales of firm $i$ in the four digit industry $k \cdot{ }^{21} S_{i}$ is the empirical counterpart to $\widetilde{F}_{i}$ in Section 3.1. The product market closeness measure for any two different firms $i$ and $j, S I C_{i j}$, is then calculated as the uncentered correlation between all firms pairings in an exactly analogous way to the technology closeness measure:

$$
\begin{equation*}
S I C_{i j}=\frac{\left(S_{i} S_{j}^{\prime}\right)}{\left(S_{i} S_{i}^{\prime}\right)^{1 / 2}\left(S_{j} S_{j}^{\prime}\right)^{1 / 2}} \tag{3.8}
\end{equation*}
$$[^5]

as

$$
\begin{equation*}
S P I L L S I C_{i t}=\sum_{j \neq i} S I C_{i j} G_{j t} . \tag{3.9}
\end{equation*}
$$

To control for industry demand shocks, we use a lagged firm-specific measure of industry sales that is constructed in the same way as the SPILLSIC variable. We use the same distance weighting technique, but instead of using other firms' R\&D stocks, we used rivals' sales. This is to mitigate the risk that SPILLSIC simply reflects industry demand shocks.

### 3.7. The Mahalanobis Distance Metric

One drawback of the Jaffe (1986) distance metric in equations (3.6) and (3.8) is that it assumes that spillovers only occur within the same technology class, but rules out spillovers between different classes. We addressed this concern in the previous discussion of microfoundations to proximity measures, where we developed a (Mahalanobis) extension to the Exposure and Jaffe measures. The empirical implementation of this theoretical metric exploits the Mahalanobis norm to identify the distance between different technology classes based on the frequency with which patents are taken out in different classes by the same firm (which we refer to as co-location). The calculation of this Mahalanobis measure of spillovers, SPILLTECH ${ }^{\mathrm{M}}$, is notationally quite involved, so it presented in Appendix C. 2 of the Supplemental Material. A similar distance measure can also be constructed for the distance between firms in product market space, which we call SPILLSIC ${ }^{\mathrm{M}}$. We present results based on both the Jaffe and Mahalanobis distance metrics in the empirical section.

### 3.8. Some Issues With the Data Set

Although the Compustat/NBER database is the best publicly available data set to implement our framework, there are issues with using it. First, the finance literature has debated the extent to which the breakdown of firm sales into four digit industries from the Compustat Segment Data Set is reliable. ${ }^{22}$ We examine this problem using BVD, an alternative firm-level database to calculate product market closeness, in Section 6.3.2. Second, Thompson and FoxKean (2005) have argued that the three digit patent classification may be too coarse, so we examine the more disaggregated patent subclass data they used in[^6]

Section 6.3.3. Third, Compustat only contains firms listed on the stock market, so it excludes smaller firms, but this is inevitable if one is going to use market value data. Nevertheless, $R \& D$ is concentrated in publicly listed firms, and our data set covers the bulk of reported R\&D in the U.S. economy. Further, we do not drop firms that exit, enter or those that only operate in one line of business. Sample selection issues are discussed in more detail in Appendix B. 4 of the Supplemental Material.

### 3.9. Descriptive Statistics of SPILLTECH and SPILLSIC

To distinguish between the effects of technology spillovers and product market rivalry, we need variation in the distance metrics in technology and product market space. To gauge this, we do several things. First, we calculate the raw correlation between the measures $S I C$ and $T E C H$, which is 0.469 . Further, after weighting with $R \& D$ stocks following equations (3.7) and (3.9), the correlation between $\ln (S P I L L T E C H)$ and $\ln (S P I L L S I C)$ is 0.422 . For estimation in logarithms with fixed effects and time dummies, the relevant correlation in the change of $\ln ($ SPILLTECH $)$ and $\ln ($ SPILLSIC $)$ is only 0.319 . Although these correlations are all positive and significant at the $1 \%$ level, they are well below unity, implying substantial independent variation in the two measures. Second, we plot the distance measure SIC against TECH in Figure 1, from which it is apparent that the positive correlation we observe is caused by a dispersion

across the unit box rather than a few outliers. Finally, in Appendix D of the Supplemental Material, we discuss examples of well-known firms that are close in technology but distant in product market space, and close in product market but distant in technology space. For example, in our sample period, IBM was technologically close to Intel, Motorola, and Apple (TECH correlations of $0.76,0.46$, and 0.64 , respectively, compared to the sample average of 0.038 ), as the technologies IBM uses for computer hardware are closely related to those used by these other companies. However, while IBM is close to Apple in product market space (SIC correlation of 0.65 , compared to the sample average of 0.015 ), due to their direct competition in personal computers, IBM is not close to Intel and Motorola (SIC correlations of 0.01), reflecting the fact that they produce semiconductor chips, not computer hardware, and IBM produces relatively few (high end) semiconductor chips.

Table II provides some basic descriptive statistics. The firms in our sample are large (median employment is 3,839 ), but with much heterogeneity in size, $R \& D$ intensity, patenting activity, and market valuation. The two spillover measures also differ widely across firms.

## 4. ECONOMETRICS

In the theory discussion summarized in Table I, there are three key endogenous outcome variables. Two of these (market value and $R \& D$ expenditure) are directly observable, while the third (knowledge) can be proxied by both citation-weighted patents and also total factor productivity, generating four
empirical measures. ${ }^{23}$ We first discuss generic issues of identification with all four measures, and then turn to specific problems with each.

### 4.1. Identification

We are interested in investigating the generic relationship:

\begin{align*}
\ln Q_{i t}= & \beta_{1} \ln G_{i t}+\beta_{2} \ln S P I L L T E C H_{i t}  \tag{4.1}\\
& +\beta_{3} \ln S P I L L S I C_{i t}+\beta_{4} X_{i t}+u_{i t}

where the outcome variable(s) for firm $i$ at time $t$ is $Q_{i t}$, the main variables of interest are SPILLTECH and SPILLSIC, $X_{i t}$ is a vector of controls, and the error term is $u_{i t}$. There are three issues to address in estimating equation (4.1): unobserved heterogeneity, endogeneity, and dynamics.

First, to deal with unobserved heterogeneity, we will assume that the error term is composed of a correlated firm fixed effect $\left(\eta_{i}\right)$, a full set of time dummies $\left(\tau_{t}\right)$, and an idiosyncratic component $\left(v_{i t}\right)$ that we allow to be heteroskedastic and serially correlated. In all regressions, we will control for fixed effects by including a full set of firm-specific dummies, except for the patents equation where the nonlinear count process requires a special treatment explained below. The time dimension of the company panel is relatively long, so the "within groups bias" on weakly exogenous variables (see Nickell (1981)) is likely to be small. ${ }^{24}$

Second, we have the issue of endogeneity due to transitory shocks. To construct instruments, we exploit supply side shocks from tax-induced changes to the user cost of R\&D capital. Details are in Appendix B. 3 of the Supplemental Material, but we sketch the strategy here. The Hall-Jorgenson user cost of capital for firm $i, \rho_{i t}^{\mathrm{U}}$, is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\rho_{i t}^{\mathrm{U}}=\frac{\left(1-D_{i t}\right)}{\left(1-\tau_{s t}\right)}\left[I_{t}+\delta-\frac{\Delta p_{t}}{p_{t-1}}\right] \tag{4.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $D_{i t}$ is the discounted value of tax credits and depreciation allowances, $\tau_{s t}$ (shorthand for $\tau_{s_{i}}$ ) is the rate of corporation tax (which has a state as well as a federal component), $I_{t}$ is the real interest rate, $\delta$ is the depreciation rate of $\mathrm{R} \& \mathrm{D}$ capital, and $\frac{\Delta p_{t}}{p_{t-1}}$ is the growth of the $\mathrm{R} \& \mathrm{D}$ asset price. Since $\left[I_{t}+\delta-\frac{\Delta p_{t}}{p_{t-1}}\right]$ does not vary between firms, we focus on the tax price component of the user cost, $\rho_{i t}^{\mathrm{P}}=\frac{\left(1-D_{i t}\right)}{\left(1-\tau_{s t}\right)}$.

Values of $\rho_{i t}^{\mathrm{P}}$ of unity are equivalent to R\&D tax neutrality, while values below unity denote net tax incentives for R\&D. $\rho_{i t}^{\mathrm{P}}$ will vary across firms for[^7]

[^1]:    ${ }^{9}$ We assume that innovation by firm $m$ affects firm 0's profits only through $x_{m}$. For process innovation, this assumption is certainly plausible. With product innovation, $k_{m}$ could also have a direct (negative) effect on firm 0's profit. This generalization can easily be introduced without changing the predictions of the model.

    ${ }^{10}$ The assumption that $\Pi\left(k_{0}, k_{m}\right)$ is non-increasing in $k_{m}$ is reasonable unless innovation creates a strong externality through a market expansion effect. In particular, this will hold as long as the products of different firms are 'net' demand substitutes (i.e., when aggregated to the firm level). If competing firms' products were demand complements, then $\Pi\left(k_{0}, k_{m}\right)$ would be increasing in $k_{m}$. Certainly, at $k_{m} \simeq 0$ this derivative must be negative, as monopoly is more profitable than duopoly. In the empirical work, we find that the value function of a firm is indeed declining in the $\mathrm{R} \& \mathrm{D}$ of its product market competitors.

    ${ }^{11}$ In the empirical work, we will use instrumental variables to address the potential endogeneity of the $\mathrm{R} \& \mathrm{D}$ of technology and product market rivals.

[^2]:    ${ }^{12}$ It is worth noting that most models of patent races embed the assumption of strategic complementarity because the outcome of the race depends on the gap in R\&D spending by competing firms. This observation applies both to single race models (e.g., Lee and Wilde (1980)) and more recent models of sequential races (e.g., Aghion, Harris, and Vickers (1997)). There are patent race models where this is not the case, but they involve a "discouragement effect" whereby a follower may give up if the R\&D gap gets so wide that it does not pay to invest to catch up (Harris and Vickers (1987)).

[^3]:    ${ }^{17}$ In the empirical implementation, the elements of $\Omega$ are based on the extent of co-location of patenting across technology fields.

[^4]:    ${ }^{18}$ This is especially relevant when these areas represent demand substitutes (as we assume in the theory in Section 1), since product market rivalry generates profit erosion only if the products in question are substitutes.

[^5]:    ${ }^{20}$ The main results pool the patent data across the entire sample period, but we also experimented with subsamples. Using just a pre-sample period (e.g., 1970-1980) reduces the risk of endogeneity, but increases the measurement error due to timing mismatch if firms exogenously switch technology areas. Using a period more closely matched to the data has the opposite problem (i.e., greater risk of endogeneity bias). In the event, the results were reasonably similar since firms only shift technology area slowly. Using the larger 1963-2001 sample enabled us to pin down the firm's position more accurately, so we kept to this as the baseline assumption.

    ${ }^{21}$ The breakdown by four digit industry code was unavailable prior to 1993 , so we pool data 1993-2001. This is a shorter period than for the patent data, but we perform several experiments with different assumptions over timing of the patent technology distance measure to demonstrate robustness (see below).

[^6]:    ${ }^{22}$ For example, Villalonga (2004) argued that firms engage in strategic reporting to reduce their diversification discount. It should be noted that this is a far greater problem in the service sector due to the difficulties in classifying service sector activity, and Villalonga (2004) in fact found no discount in manufacturing. Since our sample is manufacturing focused ( $81 \%$ of our R\&D is in manufacturing), this issue is less problematic here.
